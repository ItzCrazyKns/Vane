Perplexica is a **privacy-focused AI answering engine** that runs entirely on your own hardware. It combines knowledge from the vast internet with support for **local LLMs** (Ollama) and cloud providers (OpenAI, Claude, Groq), delivering accurate answers with **cited sources** while keeping your searches completely private.

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

Perplexica can be easily run using Docker. Simply run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v perplexica-data:/home/perplexica/data --name perplexica itzcrazykns1337/perplexica:latest
```

This will pull and start the Perplexica container with the bundled SearxNG search engine. Once running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You can then configure your settings (API keys, models, etc.) directly in the setup screen.

**Note**: The image includes both Perplexica and SearxNG, so no additional setup is required. The `-v` flags create persistent volumes for your data and uploaded files.

#### Using Perplexica with Your Own SearxNG Instance

If you already have SearxNG running, you can use the slim version of Perplexica:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e SEARXNG_API_URL=http://your-searxng-url:8080 -v perplexica-data:/home/perplexica/data --name perplexica itzcrazykns1337/perplexica:slim-latest
```

**Important**: Make sure your SearxNG instance has:

- JSON format enabled in the settings
- Wolfram Alpha search engine enabled

Replace `http://your-searxng-url:8080` with your actual SearxNG URL. Then configure your AI provider settings in the setup screen at http://localhost:3000.

#### Advanced Setup (Building from Source)

If you prefer to build from source or need more control:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Perplexica repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Build and run using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker build -t perplexica .
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v perplexica-data:/home/perplexica/data --name perplexica perplexica
   ```

5. Access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 and configure your settings in the setup screen.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings. Make sure Wolfram Alpha search engine is also enabled.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
   cd Perplexica
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to complete the setup and configure your settings (API keys, models, SearxNG URL, etc.) in the setup screen.

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like updating, etc.

### Troubleshooting

#### Local OpenAI-API-Compliant Servers

If Perplexica tells you that you haven't configured any chat model providers, ensure that:

1. Your server is running on `0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`) and on the same port you put in the API URL.
2. You have specified the correct model name loaded by your local LLM server.
3. You have specified the correct API key, or if one is not defined, you have put _something_ in the API key field and not left it empty.

#### Ollama Connection Errors

If you're encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama's API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"`. (Change the port number if you are using a different one.) Then reload the systemd manager configuration with `systemctl daemon-reload`, and restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

#### Lemonade Connection Errors

If you're encountering a Lemonade connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Lemonade's API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Lemonade API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:8000`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:8000`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:8000`

   Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.

3. **Ensure Lemonade Server is Running:**

   - Make sure your Lemonade server is running and accessible on the configured port (default is 8000).
   - Verify that Lemonade is configured to accept connections from all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), not just localhost (`127.0.0.1`).
   - Ensure that the port (default is 8000) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser's settings.
2. Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.

## Using Perplexica's API

Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.

For more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).

## Expose Perplexica to network

Perplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.
